       <p>In the birth chart of INDIA the current dasha cycles of Moon and upcoming dasha cycles of Mars are also coinciding with PM Narendra Modi’s Chart. Thus it is visible that his destiny is interwoven with that of the Nation. And this fact gives him an added advantage to his opponents who shall fight elections opposite to him unless they also have similar strong interconnections with INDIA’s chart. </p>

       <p>He is forming govt. for sure during the 2019 General Elections. And even after his second term as a Prime Minister he may still be around in the Indian Politics scene for a while in other capacities. Only time will tell.  </p>
