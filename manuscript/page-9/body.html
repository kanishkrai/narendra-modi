        <h1> The UP Equation </h1>

        <p> UP elections are very important because the major ruling party dominating the state will get the reap of their either hard work or poor work from the people. Definitely, hard work and honest work will be rewarded and the people will negate poor and unfaithful work. </p>

       <p> BJP hasn't announced the CM candidate but they are banking on Modi because he's running through favorable mahadasha and antardasha and <em>Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas</em> like slogans has given an alternative for public because UP is mired with rampant corruption and hooliganism.</p>
