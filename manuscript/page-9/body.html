    <h1> King Maker </h1>
        <p> Another key factor in his birth chart is the presence of King Maker Rahu in his fifth house in the sign of Pisces which aspects his 9<sup>th</sup>, 11<sup>th</sup> and Asc. Houses and makes him a true and hardcore politician and diplomat which allow him to take tough & harsh decisions when required. The aspect of Rahu on the ascendant not only boosts the Moon-Mars conjunction but also brings him the necessary shrewdness that is required for a politician and a diplomat in current times. </p>

        <p> However, the same Rahu aspect can make him somewhat lost from time to time. And he may come out with policies and plans that are not so pragmatic for the nation, but in his eyes they remain just and apt creating a certain amount of delusion. Such decisions pave the way for his downfall in the longer run.
