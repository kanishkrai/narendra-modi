        <h1> Demonetization</h1>
       <p> His recent widely criticized move of Demonetization occurred during the transit of Rahu in the sign of Leo over his tenth house. Saturn on the other hand was transiting the sign of Scorpio on his Ascendant house. This was the most challenging time as it could get for him since he had taken some steps which were absolutely unthinkable in India.</p>

       <p>His recent move of Demonetization of Indian Economy by banning the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes as the legal tender has generated much uproar from his opponents. Nonetheless, the entire process of Demonetization went peacefully across the nation which in itself is considered nothing short of a miracle across the globe. But this bold move halted India for about 2 months and slowed down the economic growth at least in the shorter run. </p>

       <p>Saturn in Scorpio aided in taking the series of transformative steps. His sutra for making a digital India came from Rahu. The suddenness behind the whole decision was Rahu while the secretive attitude came from Saturn.</p>
