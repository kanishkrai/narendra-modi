            Jupiter with its ninth aspect looks at the twelfth house of foreign lands making him travel far and wide for diplomatic purposes. In his chart, the ninth and twelfth lord Mercury is in the ninth house in conjunction with Jupiter. As a result, Modi's foreign policy will be admired globally and he will take some commendable steps for India relating to foreign affairs.

            The seventh lord (stands for opposition) is in the twelfth house and the lagna is aspected by Jupiter, indicating that threats from opposing countries will be tackled and neutralized instantly and Indiaâ€™s military position will only grow stronger during his tenure. Presence of Ketu in his eleventh house indicates almost a divine force in the materializing success for his decisions.
