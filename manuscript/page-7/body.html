        <p>When we think about Narendra Modi, the most important thing that comes to our mind is his massive fan following which is almost cult-like. And one of the key reasons for this inexplicable fan following is his absolutely rocking eleventh house of gains and network. </p>

        <p> Modi has a strong inherent intellect and ability for Marketing and Networking. An ability to influence the masses by being extremely quick witted and being able to do the popularity gaining tricks very aptly such as the “Ache Din Aane Wale Hai” campaign which lead him to victory.</p>

        <p>This is occurring in his chart due to the presence of Retrograde & Exalted Mercury conjunct Sun and with Ketu in the star called Uttara Phalguni ruled by the Sun along with the outer planet Neptune in Hasta being placed in the eleventh house of gains and network circle.</p>
