        <h1> Upcoming Elections </h1>
       <p> The second round of elections are likely to occur in this same period and are going to be very challenging for him. While it is not at all likely that he should lose these set of general elections, the opposition shall try with all its might to defeat him and there shall be plenty of challenges during that time </p> 

       <p>However, it indicates that the victory shall not be as untainted as the last time and a coalition government may have to be formed, which shall curtail his autocratic style of performance and bring in more check and balance automatically. The chances of another round of clear majority win shall be a wishful thinking and is not backed by the stars. </p>
