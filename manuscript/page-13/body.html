<h1> Spirituality and Politics </h1>
       <p> The presence of Ketu in his eleventh house reiterates the presence of an invisible hand of the divine in materializing his victory. It also makes him appear to be of a spiritual & altruistic disposition to at least those who approve of him and follow him. </p>

       <p>However, since Rahu sits in his 5<sup>th</sup> House of Higher Learning, his quest for self-actualization was halted half way and he had to rather walk the troubled route of Indian Politics in order to accomplish something in the more material and tangible world.
 </p>
 <p> His Rahu aspects his 9<sup>th</sup> house of dharma and the 1<sup>st</sup>  house of self. This makes him a shrewd politician who does not discriminate between good and evil actions and is able to take a tough stand to accomplish his goals.
