    <h2> Akhilesh Yadav </h2>
       <p>Akhilesh Yadav, the incumbent UP CM is born with Virgo ascendant  and its lord  Mercury is placed with Venus in the 11th house. He is an intelligent and a dynamic personality but he is currently under the Mahadasha of Mercury. This strong Mercury Mahadasha has helped to achieve greater height in the politics but the aspect of Mars can make him choosy and sometimes stubborn. </p>

       <p> With Rahul Gandhi's collaboration, the chances of forming government are remote as Rahul Gandhi is running through weak planet mahadasha, therefore bringing negativity in their campaign.</p>
