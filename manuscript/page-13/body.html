        <p>
            Ketu also has adds a spiritual & altruistic disposition to him, at least to those who approve of him and follow him closely. However, since Rahu sits in his 5<sup>th</sup> House of Higher Learning, Modi's quest for self-actualization was halted half-way and he had to rather walk the troubled route of Indian Politics in order to accomplish something in the more material and tangible world.

        <p>
            His Rahu aspects his 9<sup>th</sup> house of dharma and the 1<sup>st</sup> house of self. This makes him an intelligent politician who is able to take tough stands to accomplish their goals but also opens him up to a potential swing back and separation from politics altogether to pursue enlightenment and a higher goal of fulfillment.
