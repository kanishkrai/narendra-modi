            Presence of Ketu in his eleventh house indicates almost a divine force in the materializing of his success. Ketu also has a spiritual & altruistic disposition to at least those who approve of him and follow him.

            However, since Rahu sits in his 5<sup>th</sup> House of Higher Learning, his quest for self-actualization was halted half way and he had to rather walk the troubled route of Indian Politics in order to accomplish something in the more material and tangible world.

            His Rahu aspects his 9<sup>th</sup> house of dharma and the 1<sup>st</sup> house of self. This makes him a ingenious politician who is able to take a tough stand to accomplish his goals.
