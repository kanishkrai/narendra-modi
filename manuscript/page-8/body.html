        <p> His sutra for making a digital India came from Rahu, as Rahu stands for materialism, such as usage of Electronics item, Electricity, Information Technology etc. Narendra Modi is steadfast towards his goals. We have seen how Narendra Modiâ€™s accurate and premeditated media and social media campaigns with Virgo like precision has made him from being a Chaiwallah to being the most powerful man in India today.</p>

        <p>He is also now one of the global influencers whom the entire world is following. His well marketed policies and programmes such as <em> Jan Dhan Yojana</em>, <em>Make in India</em>, <em>Digital India</em> and so on and so forth also adds to his success and people shall remember him as the most active PM in the history of India. </p>
