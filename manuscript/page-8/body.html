            Modi has a true <em> Buddha-Aditya Yoga</em>, meaning virtue of being famous, bringing him great name from near and far. The <em>falgunis</em> (meaning?) are the birthstar of Arjuna and represent a warrior with a single point of focus just like Arjuna himself. Narendra Modiâ€™s sharp and surgical focus on his policies stem from his Virgo like precision that elevated him to the position of the most powerful man in India.

            Another key factor in his birth chart is the presence of King Maker Rahu in his fifth house in the sign of Pisces which aspects his 9th, 11th and Asc. Houses and makes him a true and hardcore politician and diplomat which allow him to take tough & harsh decisions when required. The aspect of Rahu on the ascendant not only boosts the Moon-Mars conjunction but also brings him the necessary shrewdness that is required for a politician and a diplomat in current times.
