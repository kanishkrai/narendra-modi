            Modi has a true <em> Buddha-Aditya Yoga</em>, meaning virtue of being famous, bringing him great name from both near and far. The <em>falgunis</em> (meaning?) are the birthstar of Arjuna and represent a warrior with a single point of focus just like Arjuna himself. Narendra Modi’s sharp and surgical focus on his policies stem from his Virgo like precision that elevated him to the position of the most powerful man in India.

            Another key factor in his birth chart is the presence of Rahu—The King Maker in his 5<sup>th</sup> house in the sign of Pisces which aspects his 9th, 11th and the Ascendant. These virtues make him a true politician, a hardcore diplomat who can take tough positions when required. It for example, stems a shrewdness that is required to be a politician such that BJP has decided not to announce their CM candidate there is great dependence on Modi for his campaign skills.
