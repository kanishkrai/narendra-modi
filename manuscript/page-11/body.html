        <p> Year 2018 will be particularly a period of great bonding between US and India. A meteoric rise is expected in several industries, expecially for those in film, fashion and food business. Good returns are expected for those who invest in gold, stocks and real estate during this time. </p>

        <p>There will be formation and setup of new industries leveraging the renewed energy and relationship with the US. India is also likely to get military commitment and new weaponry from the US during this period.</p>
