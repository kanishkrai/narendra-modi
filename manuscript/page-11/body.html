    <h2> Number 1 Campaigner</h2>
        <p> He has a true Buddha-Aditya Yoga bringing him great fame since this is a tight conjunction. The falgunis are the birth star of Arjuna and represents a warrior having a one pointed focus on his goals like Arjuna had. We have seen how Narendra Modi’s accurate and premeditated media and social media campaigns with Virgo like precision has made him from being a Chaiwallah to being the most powerful man in India today.</p>

        <p>He is also now one of the global influencers whom the entire world is following and looking up to either in awe and wonder or in hate and reproach but nothing in between. His well marketed policies and programmes such as ‘Swachch Bharat Abhiyan’; ‘Make in India’; ‘Digital India’, so on and so forth also adds to his success and people shall remember him as the most active PM in the history of India. </p>
