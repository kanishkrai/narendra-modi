<h2> World Politics </h2>
       <p>The lord of his fourth house & his Atma Karaka Saturn sits with his Amatya Karaka Venus which is the lord of his 7th & 12th Houses, in the regal sign of Leo in his 10th House of Public Life and Fame and giving him the highest administrative post in the government of India, and moreover, Jupiter is aspecting his 10th House from the fourth house and thereby protecting and safe-guarding his professional career by its seventh aspect. </p>
       <p> Jupiter also aspects his eighth house of sudden and transformative events where outer planet Uranus sits in Ardra Nakshatra and brings in unusual sudden and transformative events, and thus, it gave a sudden rise to Narendra Modi straight to the royal throne from out of no-where.  Jupiter with its ninth aspect looks at the twelfth house of foreign lands making him travel far and wide across the world for diplomatic purposes.  </p>
