His dashmansha chart has a Cancer ascendant with lord Moon sitting in the third house of communication in the sign of Virgo; this is the very reason for his emotional appeals to the masses in his speeches. </p>

       <p>There is a Virgo like quality in his speeches which topples down his opponents with precise facts and bitter criticisms. Be it his emotional appeal to people to wait for 50 days during the Demonetization process or his address to the nation through the Mann Ki Baat program are due to this placement of his Moon in the dashmansha chart.
