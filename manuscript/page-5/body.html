        <p class="beginning"> Narendra Modi has the mysterious Scorpio Ascendant, meaning he is secretive and at the same time <em>startling.</em> His Ascendant Lord Mars is sitting with the 9th lord Moon, the ruler of his fate, in the ascendant house itself and forming a <b> Ruchak Mahapurusha Yoga </b>, along with <b> Laxmi Yoga</b> </p>

        <p> With the aforementioned placement of Moon and Mars in ascendant, he was certainly born to be a fervent and emotive warrior with formidable spirits. He is highly energetic, enthusiastic, powerful & idealistic in temperament. He is someone who can work incessantly and with high spirits and with very little rest. </p>

        <p>It is interesting to note that his Mars is placed in the Vishakha Nakshatra that is ruled by Indra and Agni Devata which makes him seek Power and Throne with a lot of fervor. He pursues victory for the zeal of being victorious and someone who is just unstoppable. </p>
