        <h2> Synopsis </h2>
        <p class="beginning">
            Narendra Damodardas Modi is born under the mysterious Scorpio Ascendant, meaning he is secretive, sinister and likes to work with an <em>element of surprise</em> on his side. His Ascendant Lord Mars sits with the 9<sup>th</sup> lord Moon, the ruler of his fate, in the Ascendant house itself, forming an auspicious <em> Ruchak Mahapurusha Yoga</em> along with <em> Laxmi Yoga</em>â€”a bearer of great wealth.
        </p>
        <p>
            With placement of Moon and Mars in the same Ascendant, Modi is born to lead with passion and stealthy warrior-like qualities. The most interesting feature of his birth chart however is the exalted Mercury in his 11<sup>th</sup> house, which gives him the freedom to choose anything in life without failure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall Modi is energetic, powerful and level-headed by temperament. He is someone who can work tirelessly from dusk to dawn, can move oceans.
