        <h1> Synopsis </h1>
        <p class="beginning"> Donald Trump has the kingly Leo Ascendant, meaning he is determined and at the same time elusive.</em> His Ascendant Lord Sun is placed with an exalted Rahu in his 10th house of career, giving rise to his deep obsession for position of authority and fiercely territorial nature. </p>

        <p> In his chart, Mars is placed strongly giving him a super administrative ability to face any challenge easily. It also signifies that he is bullish and has an intimidating personality. In his mind, Donald is convinced that he is always right, and he usually <em>will be</em> on most issues during his tenure. </p>

        <p>Over all, Donald will think fast, perform well and is somewhat poised to make history with the help of Mercury being a lord of wish fulfilment house. </p>
