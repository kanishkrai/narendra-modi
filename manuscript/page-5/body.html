        <h2> Synopsis </h2>
        <p class="beginning"> Narendra Damodardas Modi has a mysterious Scorpio Ascendant, meaning he is creative, secretive and likes to work with an <em>element of surprise</em> on his side. His Ascendant Lord Mars is sitting with the 9<sup>th</sup> lord Moon, the ruler of his fate, in the ascendant house itself forming a <em> Ruchak Mahapurusha Yoga</em> along with <em> Laxmi Yoga.</em> </p>
        <p> With placement of Moon and Mars in the same Ascendant, Modi is born to lead with passion and stealthy warrior-like qualities. The most interesting feature of his birth chart however is the Jupiter lord in his eleventh house, which gives him the freedom to seek anything in life. And get it without failing.</p>
        <p> Modi is energetic, positive, powerful and level-headed by temperament. He is someone who can work tirelessly from dusk till dawn, can move oceans. </p>
