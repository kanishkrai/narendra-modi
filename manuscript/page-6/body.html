        <h2> Political future</h2>
        <p> Modi is among the global influencers that the whole world follows. His well marketed initiatives such as the <em> Jan Dhan Yojana</em>, <em>Make in India</em>, <em>Digital India</em> are a proof of his political successes and the whole world will remember him as the most active PM in the history of India. </p>


        <p> He has risen from ranks of lower middle class, a <em> chaiwallah </em>, with his dasha of Venus taking full force during his Suryadasha (Sun). It was the Moon in his Ascendant lord that led him to the coveted seat of a Prime Minister. His <em>mahadasha</em> (basis) of Moon lasts until the year 2020 after which he will begin another adventurous journey with <em> mahadasha </em> of Mars, which is extremely auspicious for him.</p>
        <p>Mars dasha brings in more promise. Therefore his throne remains quite safe despite all kinds of opposition. However, the antar dashas of Rahu & Ketu shall keep bringing challenges and chaos for him invariably, which he shall cross by due to his courage and dexterity. </p>
