        <h2> Political future</h2>
       <p> Modi has risen from the ashes with his Venus dasha taking full force during his Sun dasha. But it was the Moon in his Ascendant lord that led him to the coveted seat of a Prime Minister. His <em>mahadasha</em> (basis) of Moon lasts until the year 2020 after which he will begin another adventurous journey with <em> mahadasha </em> of Mars, which is extremely auspicious for him.</p>

       <p>His current time cycles of the Moon maha dasha remain auspicious for him and his throne and his upcoming Mars dasha brings in more promise. Therefore his throne remains quite safe despite all kinds of opposition. However, the antar dashas of Rahu & Ketu shall keep bringing challenges and chaos for him invariably, which he shall cross by due to his courage and dexterity. </p>
