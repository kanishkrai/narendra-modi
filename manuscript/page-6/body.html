        <h2> Political future</h2>
        <p>
            Modi is among the few successful global influencers from India. World will remember him for his futuristic outlook and razor sharp focus on development. The <em>mahadasha</em> of planet Moon, which is placed in his 1<sup>st</sup> house has led him to achieve great success and claim the highest position of power in India. This <em>mahadasha</em> of Moon lasts until about year 2020 after which a new phase or an altogether new adventure in life is indicated with the auspicious <em> mahadasha</em> of Mars, which is also his lagnesh dasha.

            Mars holds more promise for him in politics despite the <em>antardashas</em> of Rahu & Ketu which may also bring challenges and difficulties in future. He will succeed with courage and positivity but may not be able to hold his position of power on his own terms. Modi has a true <em> Buddha-Aditya Yoga</em>, meaning virtue of being famous, elevating his brand of political influence over the entire world.
