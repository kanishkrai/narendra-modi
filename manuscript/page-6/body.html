        <h1> Ascension to Throne </h1>

        <p>The most interesting factor in his birth chart is his eleventh house, which gives him the freedom to ask for what he wants and he invariably gets it.</p> 

        <p> Had Narendra Modi not asked for his throne both for the post of the Gujarat Chief Minister and also for the post of Indiaâ€™s Prime Minister and if he would have not desired this strongly then he would never have raised to this level as to where he is today. But sheerly by the power of making a wish and visualizing his success, he has risen to power.</p>

        <p>The secret of success, i.e., the law of attraction has certainly played an extremely important role in his life directly or indirectly. Such is the power of the eleventh house of wish fulfillment. </p>
