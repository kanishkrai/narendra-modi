        <h2> General Elections 2019 </h2>
        <p>
            From the birth chart of India, the current dasha cycle of Moon and upcoming dasha cycle of Mars somewhat coincides with that of Modiâ€™s birth chart. It is clear that his and the nation's destiny is currently intertwined and will simply add advantage over his opponents who will have to fight elections with a stronger dasha to defeat him.

            While Modi may form a government again in the 2019 general elections it is unlikely he would do so without external help. During his entire term as a politician will be surrounded by several controversies in future and will be less autocratic in governance than he has been in current dasha. Demonetization and its ill-effects on Indian economy will haunt him for the rest of his term.
