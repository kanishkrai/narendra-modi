        <h2> General Elections 2019 </h2>
        <p>
            From the birth chart of India, the current dasha cycle of Moon and an upcoming dasha cycle of Mars coincides somewhat with that of Modiâ€™s own birth chart. It is clear from his and the nation's <em>navmasa</em> that their destinies are currently intertwined and will simply add to his own advantage over his opponents who will have to fight the elections tooth and nail with a stronger dasha to be able to defeat him.

            While Modi may form a government again in the 2019 general elections, it is unlikely he would do so without external support - i.e a coalition Government. During his new term as a politician he will be surrounded by several controversies in future and will be much less autocratic in governance than he has been in the current run. Demonetization and its ill-effects on Indian economy will haunt him for the rest of his career.
